# RAID Calculator / RAID Rechner – Single-File Capacity Tool (Offline) – DE/EN

This **RAID Calculator** (RAID Rechner) is a browser-based, single-file tool for calculating the **usable capacity**, **redundancy overhead**, and **fault tolerance** of RAID arrays.  
It supports all common RAID levels – JBOD, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID 10, and RAID 50 – and is designed for quick, accurate calculations in everyday IT practice.

Whether you are planning a new RAID setup, verifying an existing configuration, or working on **RAID Recovery** and **Data Recovery** after drive failures, this calculator delivers instant results without requiring any installation.  
The tool runs entirely offline in your browser (pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and works on desktop, laptop, and mobile devices – ideal for on-site use during server maintenance, NAS troubleshooting, or RAID data recovery diagnostics.

## Why use this RAID Calculator?

By entering the number of drives, the capacity per drive, and selecting the RAID level, you can immediately:
- **Calculate total raw capacity and usable capacity**
- **Understand redundancy overhead** for each RAID configuration
- **See maximum fault tolerance** – how many drives can fail without data loss
- Spot **risky configurations** (e.g., RAID 0 or improperly paired RAID 10 arrays)
- Configure **RAID 50** with custom groups and disks per group
- Get **subtle safety recommendations** in critical scenarios, guiding you toward secure RAID configurations **[or professional RAID data recovery](https://www.datareverse-datenrettung.de/server/raid/)** if needed
